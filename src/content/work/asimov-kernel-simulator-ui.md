As part of my work at Asimov, I contributed to the design and development of the Simulator UI, a key feature within Kernel, Asimovâ€™s CAD software for genetic construct design. The Simulator enables synthetic biologists to predict how a given DNA sequence will behave in specific cellular contexts, helping optimize constructs for industrial applications.

The Simulator UI presents key computational predictions, including GC content, melting temperature profiles, ribosome binding site strength, and codon adaptation indices, allowing researchers to assess sequence stability and translation efficiency. I helped launch the initial version of this UI, which was a critical differentiating piece for Kernel from other sequence editing and genetic design tools.
