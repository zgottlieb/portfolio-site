The Toast Restaurant Reporting and Analytics tool delivers key performance insights for restaurant operators, providing real-time access to financial metrics, sales trends, and operational data. The interface includes dashboards for monitoring revenue, tracking best-selling items, and analyzing staff performance over time.

To build the charting components, I used Victory Charts, which provided a clean integration with React while leveraging D3.js concepts and syntax, ensuring flexibility and a smooth developer experience. To support the analytics and visualization needs, I also developed a backend-for-frontend (BFF) server using Apollo GraphQL, enabling efficient data retrieval tailored to the dashboardâ€™s requirements. This approach allowed us to optimize query performance, reduce over-fetching, and deliver a fast, responsive analytics experience for restaurant operators.
